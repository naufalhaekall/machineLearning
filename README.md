Some machine learning projects I developed

Current Stats : 2 Projects

Project Details : 
1. Voice command recognition for smart wheelchair
    * 5 Class of datasets; maju, mundur, kanan, kiri, berhenti
    * MFCC, GFCC, BFCC, LPCC feature extraction methods
    * Noise Reduction with Spectral Gating
    * CNN, RNN, LSTM classification methods
    * Real-time prediction via voice recorder

2. Make up recommendation based on skin color
     * Dataset of skin shades and make up brands
     * Image feature extraction with CV2  
     * Classification with CNN
  
**This projects were developed for course studies.**
